Being nutrition one of the biggest modifiable factors in our lives, small changes can have a big impact.  As Bangalore is the home for foodies, going out for no specific reason, sniffing the fresh aroma of coffee brewing in the various Darshinis and ultimately hopping into one to maybe have a crispy vada or a rava idli to go with it. With already a beaming number of 15,000 restaurants, the industry hasn't soaked yet. We see more cafes, pubs and dine-in restaurants being built every day; which gives birth to the question that how are the concerns of high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain being catered to. Detailed reports are an integral part of a personalization system. Accurate and up-to-the-minute reporting will allow you to make informed decisions about the direction of a campaign or the structure of a product page.
