"A good restaurant is like a vacation; it transports you, and it becomes a lot more than just about the food" - Philip Rosenthal.

**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This project is a restaurant recommendation system
(RRS), based on dataset provided by Zomato.RRS is an on-line system
to search restaurants.Visitors can browse all restaurants in Bangalore,
and get information about restaurant name,phone,rating and
cuisines served. The functions include searching
restaurants, choosing cuisines, and
viewing nearby restaurants. Aditionally, it also tells about
of trending restaurants in a week and the newly opened ones.

It works on Content-based filtering and various combination of algorthims,
the most important being quicksort,tf-idfm Cosine similarity, Logistic & Linear 
Regression, Confusion-matrix & K-means Clustering, Natural Learning Toolkit,
Vectorizers etc.

**BUILT WITH**

 1. Programming languages- Front end(client-side)- Python, HTML5, CSS3
                           Back end(server-side)- Python 3.9.6
 2. Frameworks- Streamlit
 3. Libraries- Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, MatplotLib, Scikit Learn(Model selection, linear
               models and metrics), Natural Learning ToolKit
 4. Servers- Jupyter Server(Local)
 5. UI/UX solutions- Streamlit
 6. Tools- Jupyter Notebook
 7. Deployment- Heroku Cloud Platform
