"A good restaurant is like a vacation; it transports you, and it becomes a lot more than just about the food" - Philip Rosenthal.

**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

**Food for thought!!** 

This project is a restaurant recommendation system
(RRS),which I've named Zomphy!
RRS is an on-line system to search restaurants.Visitors can browse 
all restaurants in & around Bangalore, and get information about similar
restaurant's name,phone,rating and cuisines served. The functions include
searching restaurants, choosing cuisines, and viewing nearby restaurants. 
Aditionally, it also tells about of trending restaurants in a week 
and the newly opened ones.

The purpose of this project is to help find
which new restaurants will be great for them and hence save their 
time in exploring. This dataset will help in analysing demography 
of the location, new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, 
cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between 
neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. It contains reviews for each of
the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.More importantly,
it sorts and searches the top restaurants of their favourite cuisine in neighbourhood.

It works on Content-based filtering and various combination of algorthims,
the most important being quicksort,tf-idfm Cosine similarity, Logistic & Linear 
Regression, Confusion-matrix & K-means Clustering, Natural Learning Toolkit,
Vectorizers etc.

 **Problem Statement1**- What is the most efficient sorting algorithm to use in this scenario, and why?
*Answer*- Quicksort, as  it requires little space & it is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means no additional storage space is needed to perform sorting. It exhibits good cache(ka-shay) locality, this makes it faster than merge sort, specially in a virtual memory environment.

**Problem Statment2**- Any other algorithm that you can think of?
*Answer*- I propose The infinite Monkey Theorem,which states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. The theorem can be generalized to state that any sequence of events which has a non-zero probability of happening will almost certainly eventually occur, given enough time.
